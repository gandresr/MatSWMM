### What is this repository for? ###

This is a python module with basic functions to compute cosimulation processes with SWMM. The main goal of this module is to allow its users to design optimization models and real time control systems, for drainage systems (e.g. It can be used to link SWMM with ArcGIS).

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Download swmm.py and swmm.dll (Be careful saving the files, both have to be saved in the same folder)
2. Import swmm.py 
```
#!python

import swmm
# Or import everything directly
from swmm import *
```
* You got set up! If you need help read the documentation of the module and its functions.
* Try the demo - example.py.
