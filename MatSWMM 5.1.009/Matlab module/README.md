# Matlab SWMM module #

### What is this repository for? ###

* Project:  MatSWMM
* Version:  2.0
* Author:   Gerardo Andrés Riaño Briceño (Universidad de los Andes - GIAP http://giap.uniandes.edu.co)

This is a matlab toolbox with basic functions to compute cosimulation processes with SWMM. The main goal of this module is to allow its users to design optimization models and real time control systems, for drainage systems.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Download the repo
* Select your toolbox DLL depending on your Matlab architecture (32bits or 64bits)
* Save the "swmm.dll" and the "swmm.h" files in the "SWMM Matlab" folder.
* It is done! You can run SWMM from Matlab.

Check the example file, run it and learn its structure to develop a new project with SWMM for Matlab.
Read the documentation of each function for deep understanding.

### Who do I talk to? ###
